# Photonics-FDTD-DRL
Optimization and design of photonic crystals using Deep Reinforcement Learning.

Applying deep Q learning (DQN) or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to the optimization and inverse design of photonic crystal nanocavities such as the L3 cavity and the nanobeam. 

For PPO, Ray Rllib was used. For DQN, code was written from scratch.

Note: you'll need your own .fsp FDTD simulation file in order for this repo to work.
